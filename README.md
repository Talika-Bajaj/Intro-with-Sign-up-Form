# Frontend Mentor - Intro component with sign up form

## Hi! ðŸ‘‹

This is my 21st Frontend Mentor Coding Challenge.

In this challenge, I developed a sign-up form using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, designed to enhance user experience and interaction. The form captures essential details like first name, last name, email address, and password. To ensure data integrity, I implemented client-side validation, where if any input field is left empty, a message dynamically appears next to the respective field upon clicking the submit button, prompting the user to fill it out.

Adding a touch of personalization, I incorporated animated labels for each input field. These labels smoothly transition when clicked, elegantly moving above the input field to provide context. If the input field is left empty, the label gracefully animates back to its original position, maintaining a polished user interface.

Furthermore, I introduced a 'show password' feature for enhanced security and convenience. By clicking an eye icon adjacent to the password field, users can toggle between revealing and hiding their password. The icon dynamically updates its appearance, cleverly displaying a slash when the password is visible, providing users with clear feedback and control over their input.


**Had fun building!** ðŸš€
